# android-recycler-view-wrap-content
This is a sample android app which demonstrates `RecyclerView` with **layout_height=wrap_content** not taking height of all the items issue inside `ScrollView` that happens on Marshmallow, Nougat (+MR1), Orio (API 23, 24, 25, 26 &amp; 27) and how to work around it.

 * UPDATE # 1: On Marshmallow (API 23) devices, the issue seems to happen **only on** `PORTRAIT` orientation, `LANDSCAPE` works fine. On Nougat _(Build # `NPD90G`)_ the issue still exist on both orientation.
 * UPDATE # 2: Based on solution found on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27083091/recyclerview-inside-scrollview-is-not-working), replacing root `ScrollView` with `android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView` also avoids this issue on Marshmallow+ devices. A new demo section has been added to showcase this.
 * UPDATE # 3: Updated **Support Library** version from `24.1.1` to `24.2.0`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 4 _(Sep 24, 2016)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `24.2.0` to `24.2.1`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 5 _(Oct 30, 2016)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `24.2.0` to `25.0.0`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 6 _(Dec 14, 2016)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `25.0.0` to `25.1.0`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 7 _(Feb 24, 2017)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `25.1.0` to `25.2.0`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 8 _(Apr 24, 2017)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `25.2.0` to `25.3.1`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 9 _(Jul 14, 2017)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `25.3.1` to `25.4.0`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 10 _(Oct 29, 2017)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `25.4.0` to `26.1.0`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 11 _(Feb 10, 2018)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `26.1.0` to `27.0.2`, but the issue still exists.
 * UPDATE # 12 _(Aug 19, 2018)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `27.0.2` to `27.1.1`, but the issue still exists. Tested only on Nexus 5 (v6.0.1), Nexus 7 (v6.0.1), Pixel 2 XL (v9), OnePlus 5 (v8.1).
 * UPDATE # 13 _(Mar 28, 2019)_: Updated **Support Library** version from `27.1.1` to `28.0.0`, but the issue still exists. Tested only on Pixel 2 XL (v9.0).

> `android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView` version used **[28.0.0](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L4)** _(September 21, 2018)_  - [Release Notes](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html)

## ℹ️ Why use `wrap_content`?
There may be different use case where may need to use `wrap_content`, 
one example is there may be fixed number of similar menu items that needs to be rendered.

![Fixed Menu Items](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/raw/master/web-resources/wrap_content-use-case.jpg)
 
But, it doesnt't make sense to copy & paste code for same view multiple times.
Creating views dynamically is also not that nice. So, using `RecyclerView` and `wrap_content` gives full control of creating this view.

## 🛑 When **NOT** to use `wrap_content`?
If you have a relatively medium size content with images, then you **should not** use this method to force every item to render at once. Since there is no recycling happining, you may get `OutOfMemoryError`.

# Where is the workaround?

There is nothing to see in the code. Take a look at following layout files for workaround.

 * Layout **without** any workaround - [fragment_recycler_view_without_fix.xml#L33](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_recycler_view_without_fix.xml#L33) loaded in [RecyclerViewWrapContentIssueDemoFragment.java](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/hossainkhan/recyclerviewdemo/RecyclerViewWrapContentIssueDemoFragment.java#L23)
 * Layout **with** `RelativeLayout` wrapper workaround applied - [fragment_recycler_view_with_fix.xml#L34](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_recycler_view_with_fix.xml#L34) loaded in [RecyclerViewWrapContentFixDemoFragment.java](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/hossainkhan/recyclerviewdemo/RecyclerViewWrapContentFixDemoFragment.java#L23)
 * Layout **using** `NestedScrollView` as root view - [fragment_recycler_view_with_nested_scrollview_fix.xml#L4](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_recycler_view_with_nested_scrollview_fix.xml#L4) loaded in [RecyclerViewNestedScrollviewFixDemoFragment.java](https://github.com/amardeshbd/android-recycler-view-wrap-content/blob/master/app/src/main/java/info/hossainkhan/recyclerviewdemo/RecyclerViewNestedScrollviewFixDemoFragment.java#L23)

Here is basic skeleton of layout I have used
```
<ScrollView>
  <LinearLayout> (vertical - this is the only child of scrollview)
     <SomeViews>
     <RecyclerView> (layout_height=wrap_content)
     <SomeOtherViews>
```
